    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "This task is similar to the previous one, except now the decision is not made independently for each experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have **5 text versions for a marketing email campaign**,\n",
    "and we want to test **which one performs better — and whether any of them perform better at all**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "1. Create non-overlapping control and experimental groups for each of the 5 variants.\n",
    "2. Run 5 experiments in parallel.\n",
    "3. Use **Holm’s method** to determine in which experiments there were statistically significant differences.\n",
    "4. If no significant differences are found, conclude that there is no effect, and reject all variants.\n",
    "5. If significant differences are found, select the variant with the **smallest p-value** among those with significant effects — this one will be used going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a **Type I error** to have occurred if significant differences are found when in fact there were none in any variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a **Type II error** to have occurred if:\n",
    "* No significant differences are found when in fact there were some; or\n",
    "* The variant selected for further use actually had no effect, even though other variants did have an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment parameters:**\n",
    "* We are testing the hypothesis of equal means;\n",
    "* Significance level — 0.05;\n",
    "* Acceptable probability of Type II error — 0.1;\n",
    "* Expected effect — a 3% increase in values;\n",
    "* Method for adding the effect in synthetic A/B tests — multiplication by a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** When evaluating the probability of a Type II error,\n",
    "consider the worst-case scenario where only **one** of the experiments has an effect.\n",
    "The more experiments that have an effect, the lower the probability of a Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the distribution of the measured values follows a **normal distribution** with a **mean of 100** and a **standard deviation of 10**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your answer, enter the **maximum number of experiments** that can be run with the parameters described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action\n",
