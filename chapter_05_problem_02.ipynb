    "## Problem\n",
    "In the previous problem, we found that in the 'Refactoring backend' experiment:\n",
    "- the average load time increased in the experimental group\n",
    "- but the 99th percentile decreased in the experimental group\n",
    "\n",
    "Now check the significance of the differences of other percentiles:\n",
    "- Data for the 'Refactoring backend' experiment: `2022-04-13/2022-04-13T12_df_web_logs.csv` and `2022-04-13/experiment_users.csv`.\n",
    "- The experiment was conducted from `2022-04-05` to `2022-04-12`.\n",
    "- Assume that the request processing time measurements are independent.\n",
    "- When testing, use a normal confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Action\n",
    "To check if differences between load-times of control and experimental groups, are statistically significant, I:\n",
    "- sampled control and experimental groups with repetitions (since bootstrap requires sampling with repetition)\n",
    "- calculated bootstrap quantile deltas\n",
    "- using the normal confidence interval, to check if there is a significant difference in load-time for that quantile\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "For some quantiles there was a statistically significant difference, while for others there was not\n",
    "- Quantiles WITH statistical difference of load time: 0.7, 0.74, 0.82, 0.86, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99\n",
    "- Quantiles WITHOUT statistical difference of load time: 0.78, 0.999, 0.9999\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning\n",
    "- I revised relevant Python and Pandas functionality\n",
    "- I learned how to use bootstrapping for assessing statistical significance with a specified confidence level\n",
    "- I learned how to calculate confidence interval for normally-distributed metric\n",
    "- I learned that statistical significance can vary from quantile to quantile\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "- I can apply relevant Python and Pandas functionality for similar data-related problems\n",
    "- I can apply bootstrapping for assessing statistical hypothesis and calculating confidence intervals using real-world data\n",
    "- I can calculate confidence intervals for normally distributed metrics using real-world data\n"
